# scry2 — development

Everything a contributor needs to set up a working dev environment,
build scry2 from source, run the test suite, and rebuild the Kythe
indexers (necessary for AOSP Java + Kotlin cross-CU coverage).

If you just want to *use* scry2, read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) instead.

## Prereqs

| | min version | how |
|---|---|---|
| Rust toolchain | 1.75 (stable) | `rustup install stable` |
| Linux | any 5.x kernel | scry2 uses `posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)` and `mmap(MAP_PRIVATE)` only |
| git | any | standard |
| Java | 21+ | only if you'll be running the Java/JVM indexers |
| Bazel | 6.x | only if you're rebuilding Kythe from source (see "Kythe patches" below) |
| `gh` (optional) | latest | for PRs, not required to build |

scry2 has eight direct crate dependencies — `memmap2`, `anyhow`,
`clap`, `twox-hash`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `zip`, `memchr` — and
nothing else. No build.rs, no codegen, no C/C++ compilation. The
release build takes 30 s clean.

## Build & test

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd scry2
cargo build --release -p scry2     # builds target/release/scry2
cargo test  --release -p scry2     # runs every unit test

# bench harness (optional; redb / rocksdb / mmap shoot-out)
cargo build --release -p scry2-bench
# add --features rocksdb-backend to include rocksdb (5-min C++ build)
```

The test suite covers:
* round-trip of every section (xrefs, syms, names, files, inh, calls,
  crev, typed, childrev, inhrev, sig, blob, plus the trigram dict +
  postings)
* FQN alias resolution via `add_alias`
* callgraph both directions + dedup
* substring name search via the trigram index (case-sensitive and `-i`
  case-folded), plus the short-needle linear-scan fallback
* the k-way final merge matching a reference `finish` across shards
* the C++ `completes` DEFN↔DECL bridge remap at finalize
* hand-rolled Kythe Entry decode (proto wire format, no codegen)

If a test fails, the file at the top of the failure trace points at
the bug. Most bugs we've seen during dev fall in one of three buckets:

1. **Format-version drift** — change the wire layout, bump
   `format::VERSION` and `format::MAGIC`, regenerate test indexes.
2. **Sort-order divergence** — every table is binary-searched in the
   reader. If you add a new field to a row but don't update the writer's
   sort_unstable call, lookups become non-deterministic.
3. **Endianness mistakes** — every multi-byte key is BIG-endian on
   disk so memcmp gives lex order. New row types must follow this
   convention or the `lower_bound` helper will lie.

The largest modules are `main.rs`, `kythe.rs`, `kzip.rs`,
`writer.rs`, and `lib.rs`.

## Adding a new Kythe edge type

Two files to touch:

1. **`kythe.rs`** — add a predicate (`is_yourkind_edge`) and handle
   in `process_entry`. Patterns to copy:
   * Inheritance-shaped edges → `add_inherit(child, parent)` on the
     builder.
   * Symbol-meta edges (like `named`) → `add_alias(sym, alias)`.
   * Xref-shaped edges → return `Some(role_byte)` from `edge_to_role`,
     the existing anchor-flush path emits xref rows.
2. **`lib.rs`** — add a unit test that builds a hand-crafted Entry
   stream containing the new edge and asserts the right row count.
   The existing `decode_handcrafted_anchor` test is the template.

If your edge needs a new on-disk table (rare), three more files:

* **`format.rs`** — define the row struct + length constant + section
  offset in `Header` + bump `VERSION` and `MAGIC`.
* **`writer.rs`** — accumulate rows in `IndexBuilder`, sort + dedup
  in `finish`, page-align the section, write the bytes.
* **`reader.rs`** — slice accessor + binary-search lookup. Mirror
  `xrefs_slice` / `prefix_count` exactly so the cost stays O(log n).

## Kythe patches — required for AOSP Java + JVM cross-CU coverage

Public Kythe v0.0.75 ships indexer binaries that don't fully resolve
two AOSP-shaped scenarios:

* **Java 21 bytecode in framework.jar** — bundled ASM 9.1 can't
  read class file major version 65 (Java 21). `KytheClassVisitor`'s
  `ASM_API_LEVEL = ASM7` rejects records / sealed classes.
* **services.core → Binder cross-CU** — services.core CUs don't ship
  a `JavaDetails` proto, so javac falls into a "no classpath" state
  even though `required_input` carries every classpath jar's bytecode
  under the `!CLASS_PATH_JAR!` convention. With no resolved
  `MethodSymbol`, no `named` edge is emitted to the JVM FQN, and
  write_tables can't bridge the call.

`kythe-patches/README.md` holds the per-patch detail. The summary of
the four-patch chain:

| # | file | change |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `external.bzl` | bump `org.ow2.asm:asm:9.1` → `9.7.1` (Java 23 max class file). One line + `bazel run @unpinned_maven//:pin`. |
| 2 | `KytheClassVisitor.java` | `private static final int ASM_API_LEVEL = Opcodes.ASM9;` (was `ASM7`). ASM 9 understands records / sealed / pattern matching. |
| 3 | `ClassFileIndexer.java` | new `--default_corpus` flag on `jvm_indexer`. Stock VName corpus is `""` for raw `.jar`/`.class` inputs; `java_indexer`'s `named` edges target VNames with the corpus the build ships. Without the flag the two VNames don't match and write_tables can't merge them. |
| 4 | `CompilationUnitPathFileManager.java` | derive `StandardLocation.CLASS_PATH` from `!CLASS_PATH_JAR!`-prefixed `required_input` entries when `JavaDetails` is absent. **This is the load-bearing one** — it unblocks every services.core → framework.jar cross-CU edge. Empirically: 0 → 1209 `named` edges to `android.os.Binder.*` JVM FQNs after the patch. |

### Where the patches live

`kythe-patches/000{1,2,3,4}-*.patch` at the repo root. The
`kythe-patches/README.md` next to them documents each patch
individually.

### Building patched Kythe from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kythe/kythe ~/dev/kythe
cd ~/dev/kythe
git apply /path/to/scry2/kythe-patches/000{1,2,3,4}-*.patch
bazel run @unpinned_maven//:pin       # refresh maven_install.json after patch 1
bazel build //kythe/java/com/google/devtools/kythe/analyzers/java:indexer
bazel build //kythe/java/com/google/devtools/kythe/analyzers/jvm:indexer
# outputs land under bazel-bin/... — replace the jars in your Kythe
# release indexers/ dir.
```

For scry2 users **who only run cxx / Go / proto code**, the stock
v0.0.75 binaries work as-is. The patches are only needed for the
Java + JVM cross-CU story.

## Running on a real AOSP corpus

For development we use `aosp_cf_x86_64_phone.kzip` built by AOSP's
`build_kzip.bash`. Reference numbers (full corpus, 6 KB-72 KB CUs):

* cxx — ~250 k CUs, 12-18 hrs end-to-end with 36 workers
* java — ~50 k CUs, 4-6 hrs
* jvm — depends on classpath fan-out; typically 30-90 min

For a small loop, pick a single module's per-target kzip from
`out/soong/.intermediates/...` and feed it directly:

```bash
~/kythe/kythe-v0.0.75/indexers/cxx_indexer \
    one_module.kzip > /tmp/dev.entries
./target/release/scry2 index --entries /tmp/dev.entries -o /tmp/dev.s2db
./target/release/scry2 --index /tmp/dev.s2db stat
```

Iteration is fast: 30 MB cxx kzip → 489 MB entries → 30 MB `.s2db`
in 3 s.

### Reference run: full AOSP index

End-to-end command for an AOSP corpus after `build_kzip.bash` has
produced `out/dist/aosp.kzip`. Assumes the four Kythe patches are
applied (see Path B in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).

```bash
# Outputs:
#   /var/scry2/aosp.s2db                (~3-8 GB)
#   /var/scry2/aosp.s2db.tmp            (atomically renamed at the end)
# Logs:
#   stderr captured to ~/scry2-aosp.log
nohup scry2 from-kzip \
    --kzip /aosp/out/dist/aosp.kzip \
    --kythe-root ~/scry2-setup/kythe-v0.0.75 \
    --langs cxx,java,jvm \
    --jvm-heap 12g \
    -o /var/scry2/aosp.s2db \
    > ~/scry2-aosp.log 2>&1 &

# Watch progress:
tail -f ~/scry2-aosp.log
```

What this does:

1. Spawns `cxx_indexer aosp.kzip`, streams its stdout through
   ingest. ~2-3 hrs for the full AOSP corpus, ~150-250 M raw
   entries, ~80-120 M xref rows landing in the builder.
2. Then `java_indexer.jar` with `-Xmx12g --temp_directory`
   (the JDK system-modules unpack needs the temp dir). ~2-3 hrs.
3. Then `jvm_indexer.jar` with `-Xmx12g`. ~30-60 min.
4. Sorts every table, dedupes, atomic-renames the result into place.

End-to-end wall on a 36-vCPU host: 6-8 hours. Peak RSS during
ingest: 10-15 GB (mostly the in-flight xref/calls vectors before
sort). Disk peak: ~3-5 GB for the staged `.s2db.tmp`.

If you only want C++:

```bash
scry2 from-kzip ... --langs cxx -o aosp-cxx.s2db
```

If you only have a Java/JVM kzip:

```bash
scry2 from-kzip ... --langs java,jvm -o aosp-jvm.s2db
```

`scry2 from-kzip` is idempotent on `-o`: the output `.s2db.tmp` is
written first, fsynced, then renamed. A crash mid-build leaves the
old index untouched.

### Per-CU dispatch and CU-arg rewriting

`from-kzip` does NOT run each indexer once against the whole kzip.
Stock `cxx_indexer` segfaults mid-iteration on the first CU whose
argv contains a flag Clang's frontend rejects (e.g. AOSP's
soong-generated `-compiler ...`), and that crash takes the entire
batch down. Java/JVM indexers behave better but still drop coverage
when one CU fails — they emit zero entries for everything after the
failure and exit 0 silently.

Instead the orchestrator:

1. Decodes every unit out of the source kzip.
2. Filters by `--in` / `--not-in` against the unit's primary path
   (`source_file[0]` or `required_input[0].path`).
3. Routes each surviving CU by `v_name.language`:
   `c++→cxx_indexer`, `java→java_indexer.jar`,
   `jvm→jvm_indexer.jar`, `go→go_indexer`,
   `protobuf→proto_indexer`, `textproto→textproto_indexer`.
4. For each CU, calls `kzip::SubKzipWriter::extract` to build a
   tiny single-CU sub-kzip under `--staging` (`$SCRY_TMP_DIR` or
   `/mnt/agent/tmp` by default), then spawns the right indexer
   against it. One bad CU no longer kills the run; its failure
   stderr tail is captured in the per-language summary.
5. The driver streams the indexer's stdout through `ingest_tolerant`
   into a shared `IndexBuilder`, drains the child's stderr tail in
   a thread (avoiding pipe-fill blocks on chatty CUs), then deletes
   the sub-kzip + per-CU JVM temp dir.

### Indexer-specific argv requirements

The Kythe v0.0.75 indexers each have an idiosyncratic invocation
shape. Mismatched argv produces silent zero-entry runs more often
than hard errors, so the orchestrator handles each shape explicitly
(see `build_indexer_command` in `crates/scry2/src/main.rs`):

* **`cxx_indexer <kzip>`** — positional kzip; emits Entry protos
  to stdout. No flags needed when the kzip's `argument` is well-
  formed Clang. Stock AOSP kzips occasionally carry Soong-side
  flags Clang rejects; per-CU dispatch isolates those failures.
* **`java -Xmx<heap> -jar java_indexer.jar --ignore_empty_kzip
  --temp_directory <dir> <kzip>`** — the `--temp_directory` flag is
  mandatory whenever the CU's javac args carry
  `--system <jdk_image>` (every modern AOSP build does). Without it
  `CompilationUnitPathFileManager.setSystemOption` raises
  `IllegalArgumentException` and the indexer silently emits zero
  entries (exit 0). We allocate one temp dir per CU under
  `--staging` so cleanup is bounded.
* **`java -Xmx<heap> -jar jvm_indexer.jar --ignore_empty_kzip
  --temp_directory <dir> <kzip>`** — same argv shape as
  java_indexer; reads class-file CUs instead of source.
* **`go_indexer <kzip>`** — positional kzip.
* **`proto_indexer -index_file=<kzip>`** — single-dash gflags.
* **`textproto_indexer --index_file=<kzip>`** — double-dash flags.

`--jvm-heap` sizes the `-Xmx` for both java and jvm indexers. AOSP's
services.core / framework batches blow past 2g building javac line
maps; 8g handles every observed AOSP CU; 12-16g for pathological
template-heavy units.

### CU-arg injection (`--inject-cu-arg`)

Some kzip CUs need a compiler flag the extractor didn't capture —
the indexer otherwise silently emits zero entries or fails with a
javac error. Rather than hard-code corpus-specific knowledge in the
scry2 binary, `from-kzip` accepts a repeatable
`--inject-cu-arg PREFIX::ARG` flag: any CU whose primary source path
starts with `PREFIX` gets `ARG` prepended to its compiler argv. The
flag is generic; corpus-specific rules live in wrapper scripts.

The most common AOSP-specific need is the **libcore quirk**: files
under `libcore/ojluni/src/main/java/java/` are Android's
implementation of the JDK's `java.base` module. Soong builds these
with `--patch-module=java.base=libcore/ojluni/src/main/java` when
emitting real java.base targets, but the `core-all-system-modules`
build variant whose CUs ship in AOSP's `aosp.kzip` omits the flag.
Without `--patch-module` javac sees the `--system <jdk_image>` JDK
already declaring `java.lang.String` and friends and rejects each
AOSP source file as a redefinition (`CompletionFailure: class file
for java.lang.String not found`).

`scripts/aosp-from-kzip.sh` is the AOSP-shaped wrapper. It reads
`$ANDROID_BUILD_TOP` (the AOSP checkout root) from the environment
and emits the right `--inject-cu-arg` rules before forwarding the
rest of the argv to `scry2 from-kzip`:

```bash
export ANDROID_BUILD_TOP=/aosp
./scripts/aosp-from-kzip.sh /aosp/out/dist/aosp.kzip \
    --in frameworks/base,frameworks/native,system/,art/,libcore/ \
    -o /var/scry2/aosp-core.s2db
```

Equivalently, with explicit `--inject-cu-arg`:

```bash
scry2 from-kzip \
    --kzip /aosp/out/dist/aosp.kzip \
    --kythe-root ~/scry2-setup/kythe-v0.0.75 \
    --inject-cu-arg 'libcore/ojluni/src/main/java/::--patch-module=java.base=libcore/ojluni/src/main/java' \
    --in frameworks/base,frameworks/native,system/,art/,libcore/ \
    -o /var/scry2/aosp-core.s2db
```

Implementation note: when a rule matches, the orchestrator clones
the `CompilationUnit`, prepends the missing flags via
`SubKzipWriter::extract_with`, drops the raw-proto cache so changes
actually land, and re-encodes the pbunit. CUs with no matching rule
take the fast path — raw proto bytes pass through verbatim.

If you find another patched-module / extra-flag quirk (e.g.
`art/runtime/openjdkjvmti/` needing `--patch-module=jdk.internal.vm.compiler=…`),
add another `--inject-cu-arg` line to `scripts/aosp-from-kzip.sh` —
no scry2 code change required.

### Filtered ingest via cheap primary-path peek

A full AOSP `aosp.kzip` carries ~118 k compilation units. Decoding
every one to apply an `--in frameworks/base,…` filter is wasted work
— the kept set is usually a few thousand. `read_units_filtered` peeks
just the proto-3 / JSON `source_file` (or first `required_input`)
without paying the multi-MB full decode, then drops CUs the filter
would reject anyway. On a normalized AOSP kzip this turns the walk
phase from ~3 min into ~30 s. The fallback path is also correct: if
the peek can't locate a recognizable primary path (corrupted or
non-standard CU layout), the orchestrator full-decodes and re-checks
the filter, so no CU is silently dropped.

### Resume on kill: `--resume` + delta-shard snapshots

Long AOSP runs get killed (host reboot, OOM, operator). `from-kzip`
writes its in-RAM delta to standalone `.s2db` shards as the run
progresses, so the next invocation picks up where the last one
stopped without re-indexing durable CUs.

```bash
# First run — gets killed mid-way through 12 000 CUs.
scry2 from-kzip --kzip aosp.kzip --kythe-root … \
    --in frameworks/base,frameworks/native,system/,art/,libcore/ \
    --snapshot-rows 250000000 \
    -o /var/scry2/aosp.s2db

# Restart picks up from the delta shards + the durable sha list.
scry2 from-kzip --kzip aosp.kzip --kythe-root … \
    --in frameworks/base,frameworks/native,system/,art/,libcore/ \
    --resume \
    -o /var/scry2/aosp.s2db
```

How the run is structured:

* Each worker owns its own `WorkerSink` (a local `IndexBuilder` plus
  a `pending_shas` list). A CU is ingested into a per-CU builder,
  then merged into the worker's sink under a brief lock — the
  indexer subprocess and its stderr drain run with the sink free.
* A shared `Accumulator` collects drained sinks at snapshot time.
* A `delta_rows` gauge tracks the live in-RAM delta
  (xrefs + inherits + calls + aliases + typed + childof + sig — every
  append-only delta table) across all sinks. The add (on CU merge) and
  the subtract (on snapshot drain) count the same table set, so the
  gauge tracks the true in-memory delta.

What triggers a snapshot:

1. **Row budget — the primary trigger.** `--snapshot-rows`
   (default `250_000_000`, ≈ a ~25 GB delta) bounds peak memory:
   when the in-RAM delta crosses the budget a snapshot fires,
   regardless of CU count, so the peak is deterministic no matter
   how rows distribute across CUs. `0` disables it.
2. **CU count — the coarse fallback.** `--snapshot-every`
   (default `2000`) fires a snapshot after that many *successful*
   CUs (`ingest_tolerant` returned Ok AND child exited 0 AND the
   entry stream was non-empty). `0` disables it.

What a snapshot does:

1. Sets `snap_active` and waits for in-flight indexers to drain, so
   the snapshot runs with worker subprocess RSS released.
2. Drains every worker sink it can `try_lock` (a sink busy mid-merge
   is skipped this tick and folded next time — its CU's rows and sha
   stay together, so the shas list never names a CU whose rows
   aren't durable) into the accumulator, subtracting the drained
   count from `delta_rows`.
3. Writes the accumulator's builder as a standalone delta shard via
   `delta.finish(<out>.partial.shard.NNNN.s2db)` — `O(delta)` RAM,
   no read of the prior shards, so snapshot wall time does not grow
   with the run.
4. Writes the durable `<out>.partial.shas` checkpoint atomically
   (`.tmp` + rename + fsync) AFTER the shard lands, so the sha list
   is always a subset of the rows already written to shards.

Empty / failed CUs never get a sha, so `--resume` re-runs them —
safe, since a failed CU contributed zero rows the first time.

What `--resume` does:

1. Treats any legacy single `<out>.partial.s2db` (from older runs)
   as an immutable base and enumerates `<out>.partial.shard.NNNN.s2db`
   in index order. Nothing is loaded into RAM here — shards are
   merged once at the final write.
2. The `<out>.partial.shas` file populates a skip set; the plan
   loop drops every CU whose sha is listed. Shard numbering for the
   resumed run continues after the highest shard already on disk, so
   a kill never overwrites a durable shard.
3. Indexing continues, taking further snapshots under the same two
   triggers.

The final write (always, not just on resume) folds everything into
the authoritative output exactly once via a **single k-way streaming
pass**: `write_merged_snapshot` takes the remaining in-RAM delta plus
every source (the base partial and every shard, each mmap'd) and merges
all of them in one pass — not a chained fold that re-reads a growing
accumulator per shard. Each source is read exactly once, so peak RAM is
roughly one output blob rather than the whole union. On success the base
partial, all shards, and the shas file are removed.

Failure modes the design handles:
- **Crash mid-snapshot**: the shas checkpoint is written only after
  its shard lands, so `--resume` never sees a sha for rows that
  aren't on disk.
- **Delta shards present but no shas under `--resume`**: bails with a
  clear error rather than guessing which CUs are durable.
- **Both base and shards absent under `--resume`**: starts fresh,
  prints a reassuring note.
- **Worker panic mid-CU**: `CleanupPath` Drop guards remove the
  sub-kzip / jvm_tmp paths from `--staging` even during unwind.
  External `kill -9` bypasses Drop, leaving a few files in
  staging which the next clean run wipes (`remove_dir_all(&staging)`
  at end of `cmd_from_kzip`).

Picking the triggers: leave `--snapshot-rows` at the default to bound
peak RAM; lower it on a memory-tight host. `--snapshot-every` is a
coarse durability backstop — a smaller value caps redo work on a kill
at the cost of more frequent shard writes.

## Code style — what the reviewer will flag

* Default to **no comments**. Add only when WHY isn't obvious — never
  WHAT.
* No `unwrap()` outside tests. Use `?` and the `anyhow::Context` shape
  the existing code uses.
* No `Vec<u8>` -> `String` conversions inside the hot path. The reader
  works on `&[u8]` slices and only utf8-decodes at the print boundary.
* Big endian on disk, big endian in transit. Little endian only in
  scratch in-memory state where ordering doesn't matter.
* Tests live alongside the code they cover. Format-level tests in
  `lib.rs`; verb-level tests in `main.rs` (none yet, follow-up).

## Filing PRs

1. Fork to your GH account.
2. Create a branch off `main`. Branch names: `kythe-<edge>`,
   `bench-<topic>`, `cli-<verb>`, `doc-<page>` — short, kebab-case.
3. Run `cargo test --release` and `cargo build --release` clean.
4. Open a PR with a clear "why" — what failure mode does this fix /
   what new edge does this expose. Include before/after numbers if
   the change touches the hot path or row format.
5. CI (when we add it) will rerun the bench gate at 10 M rows to
   confirm no warm-latency regression > 20%.

## Scope boundaries

scry2 intentionally stays narrow. It does **not** post-filter Kythe
output, does **not** parse the build graph for reachability, does
**not** wrap itself in MCP (REPL gives ~95% of MCP's value with ~5%
of the protocol surface — see [README](../README.md)). New
contributions that fit the lean-Kythe-edge story are welcome;
contributions that add a heuristic layer or a new query DSL are out
of scope for this repo.
